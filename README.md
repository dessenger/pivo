This repo contains program for processing data recieved from Arduino via serial and sends them to Thingsboard. Designed for sending temperature for homebrewing.

For the Arduino part, head to http://navody.arduino-shop.cz/arduino-projekty/mereni-teploty-s-termistorem.html and change sleep to 
50 miliseconds and obviously other neccesary parameters.
